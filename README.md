# ImmersiveEducationXR
This project leverages immersive technologies like Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual 
Reality (VR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make learning and professional training more 
interactive and effective. The basic concept is to address the limitations in existing learning 
methods, such as a lack of engagement, retention, and safe practice environments.   
This application allows users to project interactive 3D models onto real-world 
environments using AR, while VR provides safe, simulated spaces to practice complex or 
hazardous procedures. The system also includes AI-driven speech recognition, allowing users to 
interact with voice commands, ask contextual questions, and receive instant feedback. 
Applications span from STEM education in schools to advanced skill development in medical, 
industrial, and corporate training centers. The project is developed using a multi-platform 
approach with Unity, C#, and Blender, making it more effective and innovative compared to 
existing learning tools.
